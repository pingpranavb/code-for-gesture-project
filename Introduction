Introduction:
I made a project where a gesture sensor can read my hand movements.

When I move my hand to the left or right, the sensor understands the gesture.

A servo motor is connected to the sensor, and it physically moves like a small robotic arm.

This servo motor is placed near a normal light switch.

When I do the “LEFT” gesture, the servo motor pushes the switch to ON.

When I do the “RIGHT” gesture, the servo motor moves the switch to OFF.

Before building it, I spent time replicating a model in tinkercad, imagining how the servo and sensor would work together.

Because of that planning, when the real parts arrived, I could finish the setup quickly.

I connected the sensor, servo, and the Arduino in a clear, simple way based on my plan.

After uploading the code, the system worked: the light turns on or off just by my hand movement.

The project makes controlling a light easy even without touching the switch.

This shows how sensors and motors can work together to make small tasks smarter and hands-free.

The whole project became simple because I thought through everything before starting, which made building it much faster.

***NOTE: The project was planned two months before the time of the arrival of components!***
